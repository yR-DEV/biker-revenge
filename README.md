# Biker Revenge
- A space invader inspired HTML5 canvas game inspired by my experience cycling on roads in Texas.
- Written entirely in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 syntax will be implemented upon version 1 completion)
- Multiple layered HTML5 canvses utilized to ensure smooth running and rerendering of components and objects within the game 
- May be scrapped here depending on fate. Hopefully I am in control of that.
