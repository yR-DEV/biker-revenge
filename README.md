# Biker Revenge
- A Vanilla Javascript version of space invaders but from the point of view of a biker who gets milkshakes thrown at it (based on personal experience.)

## Technologies Used
- Vanilla Javascript (ES6)
- HTML5 Canvas Elements (60 fps - this is so powerful)

### TODO:
- ES6 OR NOT: I havent decided if I should just rewrite what I have already written in ES6 or just continue along with what I have already created
